We will be using webRTC for this project. The signalling server will be a laptop(for now) which will provide internet to both the client laptops.

SERVER
 1. In case of windows see the ip address using [ipconfig]. In case of Linux use [ip a]
 2. Look for the Ipv4 of wireless lan. That will be the ip address of the server.

CLIENT
 1. Connect to the wifi of the server.
 2. See whether the ip address of the wifi matches with the first three words of the ip address of the server.
 3. If it does the connection is successful

For PING
--------
Windows might use firewall to stop ping from coming to your laptop. Then u can allow a particular ip address to send ping using
[netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow ICMPv4-Local" protocol=icmpv4 dir=in action=allow remoteip=192.168.137.x]
Later it could be disabled using
[netsh advfirewall firewall delete rule name="Allow ICMPv4-Local"]
