1. Check if node and npm is installed using [node -v] and [npm -v]. They must be up to date.

2. Create a directory webrtc-server.

3. Inside the directory run [npm init -y].
   Output : {
  "name": "webrtc-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "description": ""
}

4. [npm install ws]

5. Steps 3 creates a package.json file and 4 installs a websocket library.

6. Create a server.js file. Save it and type [node server.js] in terminal to run server script.

7. Open any Web Breowsers and console and type the following;
            // Establish a WebSocket connection to the server running on localhost at port 3000
          const socket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:3000"); 

          // Event listener for when the connection is successfully opened
          socket.onopen = () => {
              console.log("Connected to WebSocket server");  // ✅ Log successful connection

              // Define the message to send to the server
              const message = "Hello from the client!";
              
              // Send the message to the WebSocket server
              socket.send(message);

              console.log("Sent to server:", message);  // ✅ Log the sent message
          };

          // Event listener for when a message is received from the server
          socket.onmessage = async (event) => {
              // Convert the received message (which may be in Blob format) to text
              const text = await event.data.text();  
              
              // Log the received message from the server
              console.log("Message from server:", text);
          };

8. Write the above on both clients and then send message as :
          socket.send("Hello from Client 1!");
   You should see message coming to server and broadcasted to other clients. Alco you will see the server recieving packets on terminal

9. To close connection you can refresh the browser.
